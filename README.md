# WorkdaySchedule
A 9am-5pm hourly workday daily planner.

## Description
This web application will allow you to fill out a task for every hour of your 9-5 workday.
Use your web browser to track your daily schedule!

Every hour will be marked either grey, red, or green. 
The present/current hour will show up in red, this is your current task
The past/prevous hours will show up in grey, these tasks are done or must be moved on from
The future/upcoming hours will show up in green, these are hours you still have and tasks that are coming up next.

Today's date will be at the top of the page, you can also clear the entire page using the 'clear button' when you want to start fresh (please note, this will clear all history)

You can now manage your time efficiently by scheduling your tasks and chasing down the hourly timer.

## Roadmap

Moving forward the following improvements can be made

- localStorage needs to be refined so that when accessing the highscores from the index page, they exist there already.
- local.storage does not seem to persist beyond refresh requires debug
- The questions can be extended out to include more
- The questions could also be optimised to generate randomly between the index instead of sequentially
- The radio buttons can be styled in the css to look more interesting
